# Variational autoencoder for protein sequences

This repository provides code to accompany the paper:

Design of metalloproteins and novel protein folds using variational autoencoders - link

The work describes a variational autoencoder that can add metal binding sites to protein sequences, or generate protein sequences for a given protein topology.

## Usage

To encode/decode a protein sequence:

To add a metal binding site to a protein sequence:

To generate a protein sequence for a given topology string:
