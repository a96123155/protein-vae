# Variational autoencoder for protein sequences

This repository provides code to accompany the paper:

Design of metalloproteins and novel protein folds using variational autoencoders - link

The work describes a variational autoencoder that can add metal binding sites to protein sequences, or generate protein sequences for a given protein topology.

## Dependencies
* python 3.6
* pytorch 3.1
* sklearn 0.19.1
* numpy 1.14.1

## Usage

The two tasks this work approaches is adding a metal binding site to a protein sequence and generating a protein sequence for a given topology string. The first is described as Task 1 and the second as Task 2. Below are descriptions for using the trained models.

### Task 1


To encode/decode a protein sequence:

To add a metal binding site to a protein sequence:

To generate a protein sequence for a given topology string:
